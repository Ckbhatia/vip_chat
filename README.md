# Vip Chat ðŸ’¬

Vip chat is a private chat app for VIPs only and has some special features like searching music and notifying user on slack when other person isn't available.


## What was the requirement of vip chat app to be developed?

The scanario that:

Due to Covid [Roger Waters](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Roger_Waters) and [David Gilmour](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/David_Gilmour) couldn't meet in person and have to live in their houses ðŸ˜¥

Also they don't want to use apps like Whatsapp or Telegram to talk as it doesn't has one of their favourite features - They want to search for songs within the chat itself - Makes sense for 2 legendary musicians right ðŸŒˆ


## How do I take a look?
1. You can open the app and login as one of both users.

Username: `Roger`
Username: `David`

2. After login, you can start the conversation.


### Under development
